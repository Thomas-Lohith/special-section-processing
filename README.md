The scripts in this repository allow the analysis of the abstracts of the articles of the Special Sections of a scientific journal.
The scripts in this repository allow the analysis of the abstracts of conference track. (in this README "track" and "Special Section" are used as synonyms)
The abstracts are processed with the [`slr-kit`](https://github.com/robolab-pavia/slr-kit) tool.
Each script can be run independently of the others.
The scripts are presented in the order of execution expected during the workflow.
